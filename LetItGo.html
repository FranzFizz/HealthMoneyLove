    <h3>Let it go</h3>
    <p>
        Identify activities, habits, goals that you need to let go to give room to the new training.

        We all have about 24h per day, there is no such concept as free time.
        Easy, in theory, to decide to let go habits not helping: junk food, too much sleep, too much TV...
        But difficult to implement and change habits.

        More difficult to decide to let go good things... Netflix, beauty treatments, nice cloths, nice apartments, travelling...
        but you either let them go or you will not have time or money for other activities.

        But let go only until the point you are still happy... but  you cannot have it all, so if you are going to be unhappy anyway,
        think then in the long term better. Think of a goal greater than you...

        Find also ways to optimize...
