    <h3>Training Research</h3>
    <p>
        Identify training resources you can use to close the gap.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three levels:
        self-learning (books, podcasts, videos, etc),
        Group Coaching (online or in real life),
        Individual coaching (online or in real life).

        If you already read books, keep reading will not really add great value, try coaching,
        if you can afford it, individual one would be the best.
