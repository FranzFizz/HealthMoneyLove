    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
        After working as Aerospace Engineer, seen an awesome rocket launching my lifeÂ´s work into space.
        <br>
        I had multiple surgeries, lost a kidney and I realized that, despite having a cool job,
        which I am greatful for the experience it brought, I was however not happy.
        <br>
        My health was not what I wanted, my family was bankrupt and I lost the woman I loved...
        <br>
        I needed a change and I started the journey of self-development I am currently on.
        <br>
        Since then, I improved my financial situation to help my familiy, I am starting several business and believe me,
        I am not hat young but it is never too late to change to pursue a path of a more fulfilling life.
        <br>
        I am still struggling, there are many aspects I am have not figured out but I enjoy the path, the challenges,
        the evolution...
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3>How I do work</h3>
    <p>
        I believe we all work better if we simplify so we need to focus on few items.
        <br>
        So I we start setting our attention to three <em>pillars</em> only:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Health</strong>: Physical, Mental and Emotional health.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Money</strong>: Understood as a compensation for a life of service and meaning.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Love</strong>: learn to forgive yourself and others, and live with passion and compassion.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The process to follow is simple, which does not mean easy, because it will require you
        to go through uncomfortable reflexion, take difficult decisions and hard work to create better habits.
        <br>
        In summary we will follow the steps below:
        <ol>
            <li><a href="DesiredSituation.html">Define <strong>clear goals</strong> </a>in each of the three pillars mentioned before.</li>
            <li><a href="CurrentSituation.html">Evaluate your <strong>current situation</strong></a> with respect the three pillars.</li>
            <li><a href="TheGap.html">Identify <strong>skills and habits</strong> you need to fill the gap</a> between your current situation and the desired ones.</li>
            <li><a href="TrainingResearch.html"><strong>Find courses</strong>, coaches, books and other material to close the gap</a> as soon as possible.</li>
            <li><a href="LetItGo.html">Choose what you need to <strong>let go</strong></a> in order to make room to the new trainings and habits.</li>
            <li><a href="PlanTraining.html">Create a <strong>learning plan</strong></a>... focusing on one item at a time</li>
            <li><a href="LearningImplementation.html">Implement the learning plan... with a <strong>support team</strong></a> that helps you to commit.</li>
            <li><a href="Practice.html">Practice, practice, practice</a> until you <strong>master it</strong>... then</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat the process!</strong></li>
